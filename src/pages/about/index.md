Experienced Computer Consultant with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Skilled in website development, deployment and Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Local Area Network (LAN), Training, Programming Languages, and Active Directory Experience.

I graduated from DeVry in 1986 and spent close to 10 years working as a technician at Digital Equipment Corporation and Texas Instruments. In 1987 I bought my first PC, A DEC VAXmate. I was soon dialing up every BBS (Bulletin Board System) in the Dallas/Ft Worth area checking out all the different freeware software. Before I knew it I had a second phone line and was running a BBS which become one of six Fidonet Hubs in the DFW area responsible for routing Echomail

In 1997 launched first website and in 2005 started using wordpress. Most of the sites I build are for my own marketing goals to generate and resell leads. As of 2019 I have narrowed my focus to building niche business directories for clients.

Currently focussing on sharpening my Front End development skills working with React, Gatsby Sitebuilder, AWS and Netlifly.
